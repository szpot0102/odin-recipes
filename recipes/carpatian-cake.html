                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>4 egg yolks</li>
                <li>40 g of potato strach/potato flour</li>
                <li>20 g of flour</li>
                <li>340 g of butter</li>
                <li>25 g of caster sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Step by step instructions:</h3>

        <h4>For choux dough</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place milk and butter in a saucepan. Heat on a ‘medium-low’, letting the butter melt into the milk. 
                </li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil. Add in 1 cup of flour and reduce the heat. 
                </li> 
                <li>Whisk together for a while until a thick, lump-free mass forms. It should come off the sides of the pot relatively easily. Remove from the stove and leave to cool down.
                </li>
                <li>Once completely cooled, beat in the eggs - one by one, mixing as you go. The dough should become smooth, a bit sticky and lump-free.  Divide the dough into two.
                </li>
                <li>Grab a large rectangular cake tin (ideally 9 by 13 in / 23 by 33 cm). Grease it generously with butter and sprinkle with flour. 
                </li>
                <li>Spread one part of the dough on a cake tin and even out the surface with a butter knife or spatula. If the dough is sticky - don’t worry, that’s a good thing.
                </li>
                <li>Bake at 390°F (200ºC) for 25-30 minutes, until the cake turns lightly golden. Do not open the oven while it bakes! 
                </li>
                <li>Remove to cool and repeat with another portion of the dough. Leave to cool.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Vanilla custard cream</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil two cups of milk (0.5 litre) together with fine sugar and a packet of vanilla sugar. 
                </li>
                <li>Grab the remaining cup of cold milk (250 ml) and add an egg, 4 yolks, potato starch and regular all-purpose flour. 
                </li>
                <li>Bring to boil and continue cooking for 3 to 5 minutes - whisking continuously, until a lump-free custard forms. Once you’re happy with the texture, take it off the heat. Cover with cling film and leave to cool completely.
                </li>
                <li>Place 3 sticks (340-350 g) of butter and two tablespoons of caster sugar in the bowl of your mixer. Blend together to form a light & fluffy butter mass. Gradually start adding custard, a few spoonfuls at a time, blending continuously. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Assembly</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place one layer of baked choux pastry onto a serving plate. Alternatively, keep it in the cake tin that we have used for baking.
                </li>
                <li>Spread the custard cream on top, even out the surface with a spatula or a butter knife. Cover with another layer of baked choux pastry. 
                </li>
                <li>Chill in the fridge for a few hours before serving, giving the cream some time to settle.
                </li>
                <li>Before serving, sprinkle generously with icing sugar.
                </li>
                <li>Cut into portions with a super-sharp knife.
                </li>
            </ol>
